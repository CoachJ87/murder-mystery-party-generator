## PREMISE
The glittering world of Hollywood is rocked when renowned director Marcus Reynolds is found dead at his own film premiere. The red carpet event at the historic Pantheon Theater had drawn the industry's biggest stars, powerful producers, and ambitious newcomersâ€”all with their own agendas and secrets. As the screening was about to begin, Marcus was discovered in his private viewing box, strangled with a strip of film.

The theater has been locked down, with police detaining eight key suspects who had both motive and opportunity. With cameras everywhere but mysteriously missing footage from the critical time window, the murderer must be among them. As tensions rise and accusations fly, each suspect must defend themselves while trying to uncover who really killed the controversial director.

## VICTIM
**Marcus Reynolds** - A brilliant but tyrannical director known for extracting Oscar-worthy performances through psychological manipulation and cruelty. His latest film, "Beautiful Monsters," was rumored to be his masterpiece, but also his most controversial work. Many careers and relationships were destroyed during its tumultuous production, leaving a trail of enemies determined to see him fall.

## CHARACTER LIST (8 PLAYERS)
1. **Victoria/Victor Harlow** - Marcus's ex-spouse and producer who financed the film but was publicly humiliated when Marcus revealed their marriage was "research" for the movie.
2. **Ethan/Elena Stone** - The film's ambitious lead actor whose career-defining role came at the cost of a complete psychological breakdown during filming.
3. **James/Jamie Wong** - A rival director whose original screenplay was allegedly stolen and reworked by Marcus into "Beautiful Monsters."
4. **Olivia/Oliver Greene** - The studio executive who threatened to pull funding after witnessing Marcus's abusive behavior on set.
5. **Sophia/Sam Rodriguez** - Marcus's talented but unacknowledged assistant director who did most of the actual filming without credit.
6. **Richard/Rachel Morris** - A powerful film critic whose scathing early review of "Beautiful Monsters" led to a very public feud with Marcus.
7. **Natalie/Nathan Pierce** - Marcus's current lover and the film's breakout star, whose career was launched through their relationship.
8. **Daniel/Danielle Ford** - The theater owner with gambling debts who was being blackmailed by Marcus over hidden camera footage from the dressing rooms.

## MURDER METHOD
Marcus was strangled with a strip of his own film, torn from the very movie being premiered that night. The killer modified the projection booth's security system to create a 3-minute blackout in the surveillance footage. During this window, they slipped into Marcus's private box, used the film strip with leather gloves to avoid leaving prints, and positioned the body to be discovered just as the movie was scheduled to begin. A broken cufflink found clutched in Marcus's hand and a distinctive perfume lingering in the box provide the only physical clues to the murderer's identity.
