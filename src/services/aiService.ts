## PREMISE
The glittering world of Hollywood is rocked when renowned director Marcus Reynolds is found dead at his own film premiere. The red carpet event at the historic Pantheon Theater had drawn the industry's biggest stars, powerful producers, and ambitious newcomersâ€”all with their own agendas and secrets. As the screening was about to begin, Marcus was discovered in his private viewing box, strangled with a strip of film.

## VICTIM
**Marcus Reynolds** - A brilliant but tyrannical director known for extracting Oscar-worthy performances through psychological manipulation and cruelty.

## CHARACTER LIST (8 PLAYERS)
1. **Victoria/Victor Harlow** - Marcus's ex-spouse and producer who financed the film
2. **Ethan/Elena Stone** - The film's ambitious lead actor whose career-defining role came at the cost 
3. **James/Jamie Wong** - A rival director whose original screenplay was allegedly stolen
4. **Olivia/Oliver Greene** - The studio executive who threatened to pull funding
5. **Sophia/Sam Rodriguez** - Marcus's talented but unacknowledged assistant director
6. **Richard/Rachel Morris** - A powerful film critic whose scathing early review led to a feud
7. **Natalie/Nathan Pierce** - Marcus's current lover and the film's breakout star
8. **Daniel/Danielle Ford** - The theater owner with gambling debts who was being blackmailed

## MURDER METHOD
Marcus was strangled with a strip of his own film, torn from the very movie being premiered that night.
