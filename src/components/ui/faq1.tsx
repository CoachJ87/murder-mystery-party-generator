      answer:
        "Murder Mystery Creator is an AI-powered app that designs custom murder mystery party games. You answer a few questions about your preferences (theme, player count), and our AI generates a complete package with character guides, story elements, and game materialsâ€”all tailored to your specific event needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the creation and purchase process work?",
      answer:
        "The process is simple: First, create your murder mystery story by answering a few questions about theme and player count. You'll get a preview of your story and characters for free. When you're satisfied with your creation, you can purchase the complete package for $4.99. This one-time purchase gives you instant access to downloadable PDFs including a comprehensive host guide and detailed character profiles for every player.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I save my work and come back to it later?",
      answer:
        "Yes! All your murder mystery projects are saved to your account and you can return to edit them at any time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are these murder mysteries replayable?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Our murder mysteries are designed with replayability in mind. The random murderer selection mechanism means that even with the same character set and scenario, you'll get a different experience each time you play. This allows you to host the same mystery multiple times with different groups or even with the same group for a fresh experience.",
